                <p>
                    Noah Baxter is an <b>audio engineer</b> and <b>producer</b> with a plethora of releases. Ever since pirating Reason 4 back in 2009 in a futile attempt to sound like Skrillex, Noah's been obsessed with the art of sound. Starting out in the era of cheap interfaces and free plugins, he got hooked on Ableton Live and its <i>in the box</i> diy bedroom-producer ethos. In the process of finishing 2017's <i>Ectopic</i> with his sludge metal group <b>Mursa</b>, the band ran out of money and he had to spend an entire summer reconstructing the album file by file, redoing edits and fades one at a time before finally mixing and mastering the album himself. Ever since he's self produced every project he's been a part of, and now offers freelance production for others as well.

                    <br>
                    While clearly well versed in the world of metal and hardcore, Noah has worked in a variety of other styles too incuding hip hop, jazz, indie rock, EDM, experimental, and even some classical recordings. Couple with this nearly a decade running tech at CKUT 90.3FM, a career building audio products and software, numerous live sound gigs and more, Noah is a well rounded audio professional. He currently works out of his home studio in Los Angeles and is taking on new clients.
